# ðŸ¦ˆ Seashark Language

**Seashark** is a brand new programming language prototype â€” built from scratch in C++.  
It is designed to be **fast, simple, and extensible**, with the long-term vision of powering **websites, apps, and games**.

Currently, Seashark runs as an **interpreter**, but the plan is to evolve into a full **compiler** (to native and WebAssembly).
